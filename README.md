## API

### refreshRate(options?)

#### options

Type: `object`

##### sampleCount

Type: `number`\
Default: `50`

The amount of frame samples to take before computing the refresh rate.

To compute within Â±2 frames of error, 50 samples are sufficient. However, if you can afford to wait a few more seconds, 120-200 samples can be taken for a more accurate reading.
